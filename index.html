                Walter White
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Walter Hartwell White Sr., also known by his alias Heisenberg, is the fictional antihero turned villain protagonist of the American crime drama television series Breaking Bad, portrayed by Bryan Cranston. White is a skilled chemist who co-founded a technology firm before he accepted a buy-out from his partners.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">White becomes increasingly ruthless and unsympathetic as the series progresses, as series creator Vince Gilligan wanted him to turn from "Mr. Chips into Scarface". He adopts the alias "Heisenberg", which becomes recognizable as a kingpin figure in the Southwestern drug trade. White struggles with managing his family while hiding his involvement in the drug business from his brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris). Although AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on Malcolm in the Middle, Gilligan cast him based on the actor's past performance in The X-Files episode "Drive", which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including White's backstory, personality, and physical appearance.</p>
